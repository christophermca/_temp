README FIRST
------------
Note that Contact Form ][ is a drop-in replacement for Ryan Duff's
"WP-ContactForm" plugin.  By installing Contact Form ][ , you're essentially
upgrading to this plugin.

Please read and adhere to the INSTALLATION and UPGRADING sections carefully.

------------
INSTALLATION
------------
    1. Unpack/upload the "wp-contact-form" directory "wp-content/plugins/".
    2. Activate the plugin from the Admin interface; "Plugins".
    3. Go to "Options -> Contact Form ][ " and update the fields if necessary.
    4. Create a post or page (or edit existing), and press the "Contact Form"
       Quicktag where you'd like the form to be placed. If you don't see the
       Contact Form Quicktag, you can alternatively copy and paste
       [CONTACT-FORM] where you'd like it to appear.

Bugs - Features - Support
-------------------------
One word: No.

I offer this plugin as-is (for now).  I don't have time (for now) to fix bugs,
add features, help you, etc.  I don't even have time to accept and merge
patches at this point.  HOWEVER...I may, in the very near future, host
development of this plugin on http://dev.wp-plugins.org.  We shall see.
